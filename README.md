## Challenges We Ran Into

1. **Enabling Gaming on Farcaster Frames**: Implementing a nounish gaming experience within Farcaster frames was challenging. We had to develop solutions to allow smooth gameplay within the app, akin to playing games on meta tags.
2. **Managing Database and Frames**: Efficiently managing the game data and frames on Farcaster was another hurdle. Ensuring real-time updates and synchronization between the game and the leaderboard required a robust database management system.
3. **Creating API and Game Logic**: Designing and implementing the API for **BasedJack** and coding the game logic posed both fun and challenging aspects of development. It involved crafting efficient algorithms and ensuring smooth gameplay mechanics.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Utilized for building the frontend of the application, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface.
- **MongoDB**: Employed as the database to store game data, leaderboard statistics, and player information. Its scalability and flexibility were crucial in managing the dynamic data requirements of the game🗄️.
- **Onchain Kit**: Used to obtain frames data for seamless integration and interaction within Farcaster's environment. [Learn more about Onchain Kit](https://onchainkit.xyz/).
